<h1><u>PyOBD Installation Instructions</u></h1>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

Install the following Python packages, and make sure they work.  Links
are current at the time of this writing (February 19, 2019).

<h2>Python 3.x</h2>

<p>Original development for PyOBD used Python 2.3.x; however, a
conversion to Python 3.x was done on this fork, and it is no
longer compatible with Python 2.x.  Current development work is
using Python 3.6.7, although other versions of Python 3.x <i>may</i>
work just fine.</p>

<p>Installation instructions are available at the python
website: <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a></p>

<h2>PySerial</h2>

<p>This is needed to communicate with the ELM32x device via the Serial Port. It is available
from pypi.org: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/">https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/</a>.
Download and install it. The latest development work for PyOBD was done with PySerial
version 3.4.</p>

<p>If you have <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/">pip</a> for Python 3.x, you can use
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/">pip</a> to install the latest version of PySerial.</p>

<h2>PyQt5</h2>

<p>The graphical user interface for PyOBD was originally developed with WxPython
but has been converted to use PyQt5 (a Python implementation of Qt5).  PyQt5 is
available for download at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/">https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/</a>.
The latest development work for PyOBD was done with version 5.11.3.

<p>If you have <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/">pip</a> for Python 3.x, you can use
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/">pip</a> to install the latest version of PyQt5.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>After those requirements, installation is a snap. Simply download the
release tarball and uncompress it. To "install" pyOBD on the system, simply copy
the release directory to wherever you want (i.e. /opt, /usr/local).</p>

<p>Some work has been done to create a deb install package for PyOBD, but it
is currently broken.  At some point I would like to generate deb and rpm
install packages for PyOBD.  I'll keep a Windows installer in mind as well,
but we'll see about that.
