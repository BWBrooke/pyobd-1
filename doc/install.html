<h1>PyOBD Package Build and Installation Instructions</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Obtaining PyOBD Source Code</h2>
<p>The latest version of PyOBD can be obtained from github at
<a href="https://github.com/beardedone55/pyobd/">https://github.com/beardedone55/pyobd/</a>.
</p>

<h2>PyOBD Package Build</h2>
<p>PyOBD can be packaged into a <a href="https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-wheel">Python Wheel</a>
or a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging">Debian Package</a> to simplify
software distribution and installation.</p>

<h3>Building PyOBD Python Wheel</h3>
<p>A Python Wheel is an installation package that can be installed on
any system with Python and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a>.</p>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<a href=https://python.org/downloads>Python 3.x</a> and
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/">setuptools</a> are required to build Python
Wheel for PyOBD.

<h4>Python Wheel Build Instructions</h4>
<p>Enter the following command to generate a Python Wheel for PyOBD:</p>
<div class="command">python3 setup.py bdist_wheel</div>
<p>Or if you have <a href="https://https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a> installed:
<div class="command">make wheel</div>
<p>The resulting <b>.whl</b> file can be found in the <b>dist/</b> subdirectory.

<h3>Building PyOBD Debian Package</h3>
<p>A Debian package is an installation package that can be installed on
Debian Linux or any derivative, such as Ubuntu.</p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<a href=https://python.org/downloads>Python 3.x</a>,
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/">setuptools</a>,
<a href="https://https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a>, and
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/debhelper">debhelper</a> are
required to build a Debian package for PyOBD.

<h4>Debian Package Build Instructions</h4>
<p>Enter the following command to generate a Debian package for PyOBD:</p>
<div class="command">make deb</div>
<p>The resulting <b>.deb</b> file can be found one level up from the pyobd
directory (<b>../</b>).

<hr />
<h2>Installing PyOBD</h2>
<p>PyOBD can be installed from a Python Wheel, Debian package, or directly
from source.  Generation of a Python Wheel or Debian package from source
is discussed above.</p>

<h3>Installing PyOBD from Python Wheel</h3>
<p>The Python Wheel is a platform independent package type that can be
installed on any system that has Python and PIP.</p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<a href=https://python.org/downloads>Python 3.x</a> and
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip3</a> are required to install
PyOBD from a Python Wheel.
<h4>PyOBD Python Wheel Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>Enter the following command to install the Python Wheel:</p>
<div class="command">pip3 install pyobd_beardedone55-0.9.4-py3-none-any.whl</div>
<p>This will install PyOBD along with any other required packages, such as PyQt5 and
PySerial.</p>

<h3>Installing PyOBD from Debian Package</h3>
<p>The Debian package is a package type that can be
installed on any system that is running a Debian Linux or
any derivative, such as Ubuntu.</p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<a href=https://python.org/downloads>Python 3.x</a>,
<a href=https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/>PyQt5</a>, and
<a href=https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/>pyserial</a>, are
required to install PyOBD from a Debian package.
<h4>PyOBD Debian Package Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>Enter the following command to install the Debian package:</p>
<div class="command">sudo dpkg -i python3-pyobd-beardedone55_0.9.4_all.deb</div>
<p>This will <i>not</i> install any packages that are required by PyOBD, such as
PyQt5 and pyserial. The installation will fail if the required packages are
not already installed.</p>

<h3>Installing PyOBD from Source</h3>
<p>PyOBD may also be installed directly from the source.</p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<a href=https://python.org/downloads>Python 3.x</a> and
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/">setuptools</a> are required to install
PyOBD from source.
<h4>PyOBD Source Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>To install for all users, enter the following command from the source directory:</p>
<div class="command">sudo python3 setup.py install</div>
<p>To install for the current user only, enter the following command from the source directory:</p>
<div class="command">python3 setup.py install --user</div>
<p>This will install PyOBD along with any other required packages, such as PyQt5 and
PySerial.</p>
